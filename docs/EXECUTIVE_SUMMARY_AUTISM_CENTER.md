### How Aivo Adapts

Aivo's AI brain continuously learns each student's:

- **Learning style** — visual, auditory, kinesthetic preferences
- **Pace** — processing speed and optimal session length
- **Interests** — special interests woven into content for engagement
- **Triggers** — environmental and task-related stressors to avoid
- **Strengths** — areas of competence leveraged to build confidence
- **Communication needs** — language level, AAC requirements, processing time

The system then automatically:
- Adjusts content difficulty in real-time

- Offers breaks at optimal intervals
- Delivers reinforcement matched to preferences
- Alerts caregivers when intervention may be needed
