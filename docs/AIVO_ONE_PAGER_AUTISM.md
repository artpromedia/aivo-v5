# AIVO LEARNING

## AI-Powered Adaptive Learning for Neurodiverse Learners

---

### THE CHALLENGE

Autism centers face a difficult balancing act: delivering truly individualized interventions while managing documentation requirements, parent communication, and limited staff hours. Generic educational software fails to address the unique needs of autistic learners—lacking visual supports, sensory considerations, and evidence-based autism interventions.

---

### THE SOLUTION

**Aivo** is an adaptive learning platform built from the ground up for neurodiverse learners. Our AI personalizes every interaction based on each learner's profile, interests, sensory needs, and communication style—delivering consistent, evidence-based support at scale.
